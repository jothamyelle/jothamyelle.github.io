                      The company I was working for was in a tight situation, so I helped them out.
                      I spent months teaching myself PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Before too long, I went from zero 
                      coding experience to having made a web-app, complete with form submissions, pdf uploads, sms and 
                      email notifications.  The company I made it for is still using it to this day.

                    This was a smaller Vancouver-based company, which meant that there was a lot of room to grow.  
                    I enjoyed working here as it allowed me many opportunities to learn and develop skills that 
                    I might not have had otherwise.  I did everything from physical labour in the yard/warehouse 
                    to driving forklifts and 3-ton trucks to developing and maintaining the company's website and 
                    web-app. Whenever there was a job or task that seemed challenging or beyond my skillset, I would
                    jump at the chance to tackle it.  Because of my strong work ethic, I often found myself setting
                    the pace at whatever job site I was at that day.  I got along really well working in a team, but I 
                    also excelled when I was left unsupervised, consistently exceeding the expectations of my superiors.

                    In this intense 10-week, 12-hour-days, 5-days-per-week web development bootcamp, I learned and 
                    developed skills working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, Express, Bootstrap, Knex, PostgreSQL, 
                    MongoDB, jQuery, and more.  The hands on approach and readily-available mentorship allowed me 
                    to learn quickly and practice writing clean, readable, and modular code.  I've gained an appreciation for 
                    writing DRY code and keeping things organized.  One of the most helpful aspects to this program
                    was the experience I gained with git/GitHub and collaborating with a team.

                Online learning has always been an attractive thing for me.  Within my first year here, I've studied
                object-oriented programming, coupling and cohesion, and database structures using the C++ language and 
                a MySQL database.

                Having access to 5 professional-rate studios and mentorship from industry professionals allowed for 
                rapid growth in the audio engineering field.  I became skilled in recording, editing, mixing, producing, 
                and mastering audio with a specialization in sound for video games and film.  It was actually while
                creating sounds for video games where I developement an appreciation for software development.
